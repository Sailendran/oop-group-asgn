Iceland is a Northern European country, widely considered to be the final frontier of The Nordic World. A comparatively small and largely uninhabited island, Iceland faces harsh winters and mild summers due to its northerly latitude and marine influence. Most of Iceland is said to have a polar climate. Iceland also sits across two different continental plates, meaning that it is home to - and in fact, is the product of the eruptions of - volcanoes.<br><br>According to The Government of Iceland, the nation faces many natural hazards including storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides and avalanches, among others.<br><br>To prevent getting caught out in a volcanic eruption, the government of Iceland recommends that its citizens keep tabs on public and aviation alerts on impending natural hazards - including potential volcanic activity.<br><br>In the event of a volcanic eruption, The CDC recommends that victims first evacuate the area affected by lava flow, moving aside from the area of effect rather than directly away from the path of the lava flow, preferably in a vehicle. If victims suffer burns, they are requested to seek immediate help as these injuries can be life-threatening.<br><br>During ashfall, victims are advised to wear clothes which cover as much skin as possible, along with goggles and a facemask. During this stage of the disaster, victims are also encouraged not to use their vehicles as the ash can stall vehicles and cause air conditioning to clog and choke the occupants of vehicles.<br><br>While Iceland may also face floods, more information on surviving this type of disaster can be found under the section for information on Malaysia.<br><br>
