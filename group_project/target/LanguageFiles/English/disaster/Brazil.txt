Brazil is a South American nation along the east coast of the continent. It spans most of the length of South America. The country has an area of about eight-and-a-half square kilometres and a coastline of about 7, 500 kilometres. The nation is home to the world's largest tropical rainforests and diverse wildlife. <br><br>Brazil is classified as one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries and the majority of the nation is classified as a Monsoon, tropical savanna and warm oceanic climate. In Brazil, part of 85% of disasters is caused by landslides. These events are especially prevalent in tropical areas but can be mitigated by government policy aimed. Over the past 50 years, more than 10 thousand Brazilians have died due to natural disasters,the plurality of which are in hillside collapses.<br><br>According to The Government of The United Kingdom, the rainy season in Brazil lasts between November and March. The UK Government advises its citizens to be alert for local authority warnings that are often displayed on digital signs on the streets and sent out to hotels and hostels. They also caution against travelling on the road during heavy rains as cars and busses have been caught in fatal landslides. They also advise people not to walk in flooded areas or cross fast flowing waters as they may be swept away.<br><br>If you are caught in a landslide /*no escape from reality*/ you should move away from the threat - approaching an active landslide can be fatal. Escaping upwards is usually the safer option; either move upstairs or stand on top of a solid object. If possible, enter an interior area that is not furnished as they tend to be safer. Lastly, opening downhill doors and windows will allow debris to escape.<br><br>After a landslide, listen out for noise that may be made by survivors to alert rescuers and if you are caught under debris, make noise to alert others to your location.<br><br>
