Brazil is a South American nation along the east coast of the continent. It spans most of the length of South America. The country has an area of about eight-and-a-half square kilometres and a coastline of about 7, 500 kilometres. The nation is home to the world's largest tropical rainforests and diverse wildlife. <br><br>Brazil is classified as one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries and the majority of the nation is classified as a Monsoon, tropical savanna and warm oceanic climate. In Brazil, part of 85% of disasters is caused by landslides. These events are especially prevalent in tropical areas but can be mitigated by government policy aimed. Over the past 50 years, more than 10 thousand Brazilians have died due to natural disasters,the plurality of which are in hillside collapses.<br><br>According to The Government of The United Kingdom, the rainy season in Brazil lasts between November and March. The UK Government advises its citizens to be alert for local authority warnings that are often displayed on digital signs on the streets and sent out to hotels and hostels. They also caution against travelling on the road during heavy rains as cars and busses have been caught in fatal landslides. They also advise people not to walk in flooded areas or cross fast flowing waters as they may be swept away.<br><br>If you are caught in a landslide /*no escape from reality*/ you should move away from the threat - approaching an active landslide can be fatal. Escaping upwards is usually the safer option; either move upstairs or stand on top of a solid object. If possible, enter an interior area that is not furnished as they tend to be safer. Lastly, opening downhill doors and windows will allow debris to escape.<br><br>After a landslide, listen out for noise that may be made by survivors to alert rescuers and if you are caught under debris, make noise to alert others to your location.<br><br>
Canada - a country that spans six timezones across the Northern half of The North American Continent - has a whopping area of almost 10 million square kilometres and just over 240, 000 kilometres. The vast majority of the country is classified in The Köppen climate system as being Subarctic (Dfc). Canada is divided into 10 provinces, including the former country of Newfoundland in the east.<br><br>According to belairdirect.com, Canada faces many types of natural disasters, including forest fires, floods, torrential rains, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, landslides and ice storms. In recent years the frequent occurrence of forest fires has left tens of thousands of residents displaced.<br><br>While some of these disasters can be attributed to climate change, some of these disasters such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes cannot and have not been manipulated by climate change.<br><br>As far as disaster management goes, Canadians are advised by NRCAN to install Carbon dioxide detectors, proper ventilation and water sprinklers in their homes. Canadians are also encouraged to have disaster kits on hand in case of fires, a vehicle with a full tank and to bring along pets and valuables.<br><br>NRCAN also advises that those at risk also carry HEPA filters and prepare their homes by removing flammable materials, which may include dead vegetation, dead leaves and debris. An escape plan - including a rendezvous point outside the area of effect - is also incredibly valuable and should be discussed with all members of the household.<br><br>More information on surviving floods can be found under the section for information on surviving natural disasters in Malaysia, and information on surviving volcanic eruption can be found under the section for surviving natural disasters in Iceland.<br><br>
Iceland is a Northern European country, widely considered to be the final frontier of The Nordic World. A comparatively small and largely uninhabited island, Iceland faces harsh winters and mild summers due to its northerly latitude and marine influence. Most of Iceland is said to have a polar climate. Iceland also sits across two different continental plates, meaning that it is home to - and in fact, is the product of the eruptions of - volcanoes.<br><br>According to The Government of Iceland, the nation faces many natural hazards including storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides and avalanches, among others.<br><br>To prevent getting caught out in a volcanic eruption, the government of Iceland recommends that its citizens keep tabs on public and aviation alerts on impending natural hazards - including potential volcanic activity.<br><br>In the event of a volcanic eruption, The CDC recommends that victims first evacuate the area affected by lava flow, moving aside from the area of effect rather than directly away from the path of the lava flow, preferably in a vehicle. If victims suffer burns, they are requested to seek immediate help as these injuries can be life-threatening.<br><br>During ashfall, victims are advised to wear clothes which cover as much skin as possible, along with goggles and a facemask. During this stage of the disaster, victims are also encouraged not to use their vehicles as the ash can stall vehicles and cause air conditioning to clog and choke the occupants of vehicles.<br><br>While Iceland may also face floods, more information on surviving this type of disaster can be found under the section for information on Malaysia.<br><br>
Malaysia is a South-East Asian nation that experiences tropical climates. It lays just north of the equator and has a vast coastline of approximately 4, 675 kilometres. The country is spliced in half by The South China Sea, with the Malayan Peninsular - where the capital, Kuala Lumpur is located - on the west and the Bornean states of Sabah and Sarawak in the east.<br><br>Malaysia is generally not ailed by extreme disaster events, however, the nation regularly faces floods, landslides and severe haze. In recent years, several extreme weather events have plagued the nations, causing financial difficulty to the people and government. The country also regularly experiences The El Nino weather phenomenon and monsoon seasons.<br><br>According to NIDM (nidm.gov.in), the cause of many of Malaysia's natural disasters is due to rapid development, unplanned urbanisation, global  climate change and environmental degradation. NIDM indexes Malaysia with the following diagram:<br><br>FMT recommends that those facing heavy rains keep tabs on meteorological news reports. Having an escape plan to higher ground and even keeping tabs on nearby water sources can add vital minutes to one's response time.<br><br>In addition, preparing one's home by disconnecting electrical appliances may prevent death by electrocution, while moving important posessions to the highest point in ones house may prevent excessive property damage.<br><br>Having a disaster supply kit which includes food, water, clothes and first aid may prove life-saving should things go south. Having your mobile phone on you may also prove handy as communication can help authorities reach you if you end up displaced from your residence or large groups of survivors.<br><br>Lastly, flood survivors should not be hasty to return to their homes as floods can erode the structure of a building and downed electrical lines can cause electrocution hazards. In Malaysia, venomous snakes are also a concern as they may wash up inside flooded homes and thus homeowners should exercise caution upon their return to their homes.<br><br>
New Zealand is an island nation off the coast of Australia. It is situated far south in the Pacific Ocean and has a climate classified as temperate-maritime (Cfb). New Zealand has a vast coastline (15, 000 km) for its area (268, 021 km²). Sitting along The Pacific Ring of Fire, New Zealand is also home to one of the world's most active supervolcanoes - The Taupō Volcano.<br><br>New Zealand is susceptible to tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, droughts, tornadoes, bushfires, and volcano-related natural disasters. Moovaz.com regards this to be at least in part due to the effects of climate change and global warming.<br><br>New Zealand's most common natural disaster is earthquakes - with Wellington facing up to 14, 000 earthquakes a year. <br><br>According to getthru.govt.nz, The cause of earthquakes in New Zealand is due to tectonic faults, where the tectonic plates collide, grind against each other and diverge. They go on to say that most earthquake-related casualties result from falling debris, flying glass and collapsing structures such as buildings and bridges. Secondary disasters such as landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires and tsunamis are also caused by earthquakes.<br><br>The Government of New Zealand recommends that households have an emergency plan and a stash of basic necessities and first aid supplies. They also recommend that safe places be found in schools, places of work and homes, as well as to ensure these places from earthquake damage. Heavy furniture should be secured to the building and buildings should comply with national building codes.<br><br>In the event of an earthquake, it is wisest to drop to the ground, seek cover under a solid table or another piece of furniture and stay there until the shaking stops and it is safe to exit. If you are outdoors, move a few feet away from buildings, trees, streetlights and power lines before dropping, and looking for cover to wait out the earthquake.<br><br>Those on beaches should drop and cover before moving to higher ground if a tsunami follows the earthquake. Drivers should pull over until the shaking stops and be cautious over bridges and ramps that may have been damaged. Those in mountainous areas should avoid unstable slopes and cliffs while being alert for falling debris or landslides.<br><br>For more information on floods, look in the section for information on natural disasters in Malaysia.
